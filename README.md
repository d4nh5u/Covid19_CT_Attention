## Abstract <a name = "abstract"></a>
This project investigates the efficacy of attention mechanisms integrated with baseline models for analyzing **COVID-19-CT** dataset. Our team explored different attention mechanisms like **SE**, **CBAM**, **ECA**, and compared their impact on baseline models such as **ResNet-50**, **ResNeXt-50**, **DenseNet121**, **DenseNet169** and **ConvNeXt-Tiny**. The study involved rigorous evaluation through metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the use of **Grad-CAM** for visualization. Our findings contribute valuable insights into the application of attention mechanisms in medical image analysis, specifically for **COVID-19-CT** datasets.

:mega: Experimental results and in-depth analysis will be presented in a formal paper in the future. :mega:
